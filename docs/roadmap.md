# Sim-to-Real Roadmap

1. Consolidate simulation performance across seeds and domain randomization sweeps.
2. Validate safety supervisor and command filtering in simulation-in-the-loop.
3. Perform staged rollout on hardware with progressively wider workspaces.
4. Document calibration, synchronization, and emergency procedures.
5. Iterate with offline RL / fine-tuning to close the sim-to-real gap.
